#The data forms a natural social graph for New York's social elite.  #
#Link = [run-of-the-mill holiday party](http://www.newyorksocialdiary.com/party-pictures/2014/holiday-dinners-and-doers).

# In this project, we will assemble the social graph from photo captions for parties dated December 1, 2014, and before.  Using this graph, we can make guesses at the most popular socialites, the most influential people, and the most tightly coupled pairs.

# We will attack the project in three stages:
# 1. Get a list of all the photo pages to be analyzed.
# 2. Parse all of the captions on a sample page.
# 3. Parse all of the captions on all pages, and assemble the graph.
